# To-Do Application

## Description

The To-Do List App is a simple, interactive web application built with React. The app allows users to manage tasks by adding, viewing, marking as complete, and deleting to-do items. Users can categorize tasks into completed and incomplete tasks and manage their to-do lists efficiently. The app uses React for state management and Bootstrap for styling to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
